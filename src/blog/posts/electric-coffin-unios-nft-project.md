## What is Unios, and how can you participate and learn more?

The Seattle artist **Electric Coffin** is working on "Unios" which is their [generative NFT project](https://medium.com/@UniosWorld/unios-a-generative-nft-project-that-creates-personal-connections-with-nature-and-technology-in-the-656baa8b1a85) that creates personal connections with nature and technology in the physical and virtual worlds.

**Update**: The NFT minting date has been announced for Feb 16th, 2022.

I discovered the Unios project though my exploration of Web3 and wanted to learn more because it:

- explores the intersection of art and technology through a digital generative art project
- has a roadmap that includes offseting carbon used by the project, supporting other artists, and ultimately funding rewilding efforts in Africa and beyond. See below for their Discord server and visit `#roadmap`
- offers an opportunity to connect with the talented Seattle-based team in real life
- has a growing online community
- connects with physical art exhibits in the real world

**If you're in the Seattle area, I recommend you visit their [Future Machine Vol 4](/blog/electric-coffin-future-machine-vol-4-exhibit-seattle/) exhibit** which runs through May 1, 2022.

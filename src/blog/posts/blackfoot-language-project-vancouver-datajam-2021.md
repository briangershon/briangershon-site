## Our Project

During the one-day Vancouver DataJam 2021 hackathon our team developed the start of an interactive application that allows an English speaker to learn the Blackfoot language, as well as record audio to determine accuracy.

We decided to build a website that has two primary pieces:

- A web-based interface that takes a user through a story for exploring and hearing the Blackfoot language.

- A feature to record and provide feedback on how well the user pronounced the Blackfoot translation.

This project was suggested by the Department of Indigneous Studies and Department of Computing Science, at Simon Fraser University, by Professor Eldon Yellowhorn and Dr. Angelica Lim and is part of the [Blackfoot Revitalization Project](http://blackfoot-revitalization.cs.sfu.ca/) whose "goal is to build technologically innovative language learning tools to aid in the revitalization and preservation of the Blackfoot language." which had created the [Blackfoot Chatbot](http://bf-study-app.cs.sfu.ca/).

## Team Accomplishments

We:

1. Created a story interface design:

2. Built a working web application that supports story telling, plays Blackfoot audio clips, and has the ability to ingest audio recordings for accuracy analysis:

3. Built a Data Science notebook demonstrating data analysis for determining accuracy of pronunciation. Screenshots from the this [live Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/BryceHaley/team7-blackfoot-chat-app/blob/main/backend/audio_experiments.ipynb):

The [Museum of Museums](https://www.museumofmuseums.com/) is a fantastic contemporary art center in Seattle.

This was my first visit and am excited to return.

Here are some of the current exhibits through May 1st, 2022.

## Exhibit: Future Machine Vol 4

See my post on Electric Coffin's [Future Machine Vol 4](/blog/electric-coffin-future-machine-vol-4-exhibit-seattle/).

## Exhibit: CAT TOWER!

CAT TOWER! is a family-friendly (and cat-friendly!) exhibit exploring the best designs in cat towers.

An exerpt from the exhibit:

```
The cat tower reflects one of the most neglected objects
in the design kingdom.

Invented by Frank Crow in 1968, he outlined the three traits
that a successful cat tower must provide:

1 - A clawing surface of maximum appeal to a cat
2 - A climbing structure of high appeal and good exercising
3 - A facility for playing, feeding and sleeping
```

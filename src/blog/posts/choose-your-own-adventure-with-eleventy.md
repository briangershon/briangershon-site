Thank you for joining me for my Eleventy presentation at the [BellevueJS Meetup on January 28th 2020](https://www.meetup.com/BellevueJS/events/llvkklybccblc/).

We walked through creating content and features quickly with Eleventy and off-the-shelf Vanilla JS, starting with an intro, discussed the problem being solved, compared a bit with Gatsby, and accelerated into generating 10,000 pages.

Here's a copy of my <a href="https://www.briangershon.com/presents/eleventy-adventure/">presentation</a>.

Please <a href="/about/">contact me</a> if you have questions, or if you want to share the Eleventy or JAMstack projects you're working in.

Here are some handy links too:
